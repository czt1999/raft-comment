# raft-sketch
This repository is a summary for [MIT6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html)'s lab as well as some way to prove personal project experience. 

It is not expected to break the course's rule. Implementations are erased and replaced with comments in Chinese. You will find it really a "sketch", which provides a general guidelines, as a reference for people interested in Raft to figure out their own solution.

For simplification, code provided by the course itself (labgob, labrpc, etc.) is omitted.

Please open an issue if you have any advice or question.
